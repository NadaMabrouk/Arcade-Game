# Arcade-Game
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to collect the golds appear so he can move from level to level, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, he loses a life (out of three lifes at the beginning of the game, but the player can collect more during the game).

## Game Rules
-The player can move left, right, up and down through the arrow keys in the keyboard.
-The player has three lives at the beginning of the game and can gain more.
-The Game is composed of 7 levels.

### How the code was built
This is a project in the Udacity Front-End development nanodegree. 
I was given the basic canvas (Play Area) and i started building the **app.js** file which contains all the elements logic and started updating the **engine.js** so i can add the rendering and the updating of each entity in the game (Player, Bugs, Lifes and Score Sections).
What i've learned throughout this project:
-Javascript Superclasses and Subclasses.
-HTML5 canvas.
-HTML audio.
