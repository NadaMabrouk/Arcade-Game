# Arcade-Game
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to collect the golds appear so he can move from level to level, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, he loses a life (out of three lifes at the beginning of the game, but the player can collect more during the game). Once the player reaches Level 7 he wins !
